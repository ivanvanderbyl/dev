        This is Ivan Vanderbyl. I'm the a Product Manager at{" "}
        <a href="https://tricentis.com" target="_blank">
          Tricentis
        </a>{" "}
        working on Load Testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I co-founded Flood IO
        <i> (Acq. Tricentis, June 2017)</i> and worked as a Software Engineer at{" "}
        <a href="https://digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a> in the early days.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the last 12+ years I've founded 4 companies, exited 2, crashed and
        burned 1, and fizzled out another.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've worked in Product related roles including Engineering, Design, and
        Management. I enjoy the challenges of pushing products forward and
        challenging what is technically possible.
